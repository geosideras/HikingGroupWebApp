## About the Project

This project was created as part of my learning journey with .NET MVC and C#. I followed steps and inspiration from [Teddy Smith](https://github.com/teddysmithdev) to gain hands-on experience with web development concepts and best practices. This app serves as a practical example of what I learned throughout the process.
